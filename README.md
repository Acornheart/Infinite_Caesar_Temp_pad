Hello this is my first real project on a github not exactly sure how these are supposed to be organized
but currently the design works by making a caesar class a infini temp pad class that builds on the caesar to do the actual work the infi tempad class just changes the shift every time
its probaly messy and there's defitnely a better way to do it but I like it
